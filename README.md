# MicroStream Quarkus Usage Patterns

Patterns in using MicroStream's Quarkus integration

This repository contains a few example projects that demonstrate how MicroStream and
the MicroStream Quarkus integration can be used in a project.

It is not the idea to have all best practices around application development covered
in these examples but only some patterns that can be used to work with the Object Graph that
makes your database within the JVM heap (and persist data with MicroStream).  
So aspects like security and observability are not covered but are also not affected by using MicroStream in your Quarkus application.

## General concepts

The following are a few general concepts that are applied within the examples.

- The *Controller* classes are responsible for defining the JAX-RS endpoint signatures (HTTP method, URLs, ...) and some validation on the received data (structures). So the _Controller_ is not responsible for validating the business rules (does the user exists, can the customer place an order, ...) but merely some validation of the received values/structures (Are values in a certain range like non-negative for age, does the supplied JSON has a property email, ...)
- The *Service* classes are responsible for validating the business rules of your application.  They should not have any JAX-RS-specific relation so in case there is a problem with a request, a RuntimeException-based exception can be thrown.

Basic project is generated by Quarkus project generator with extensions JAX-RS, CDI/ARC and MicroProfile.


## Example

The example supports (in a limited way) the management of a library.  You have the concept books and users who can lend a book.

You can perform the following actions

- Retrieve all known books.
- Retrieve all known users.
- Add a new User.
- Update the email address of a User.
- Retrieve the books assigned to a user.
- Assign a book to the user.

Although the application is still limited in functionality, it is already a bit more elaborated than a hello-world style application. With a hello-world style example, we would have the danger of showing patterns that do not apply to the real world.

# Plain

Without the integration code, see directory _plain_.

Without any integration code, you need to expose a (Quarkus) CDI bean for the `StorageManager`. This is performed by the `DataConfiguration` class.  The class is injected with the configuration value `one.microstream.config` which will give us the location of the MicroStream configuration file. It also has a reference to the class that performs the initialisation of books and users when the storage is started for the very first time.

The CDI producer method performs the different steps in a similar way as when you use MicroStream in a Java SE program.  It creates the `EmbeddedStorageFoundation` with the configuration file, it customizes the Foundation, creates the _StorageManager_, and initializes with data if needed.

The Quarkus beans are only created when requested. This means that the _StorageManager_ is only created when the first request arrives and thus lazily initialised which is what is required for most applications.
